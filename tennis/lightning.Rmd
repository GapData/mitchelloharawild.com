# Motivation

## We want to understand emotion to determine how it impacts the play of a game.

# How can we collect emotion data?

### Not feasible
]

???

We can't interrupt the match to ask how they're feeling after every point.

### Questionable self-reporting accuracy

### Key area for improvement is improving robustness to individual expressions
